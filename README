Trigger Test
============

This repository contains a simple toy MC to simulate the CMS level 1 and level
2 triggers. It is used to check whether the trigger scale factor calculation
for the R(D*) analsyis is correct. Right now, we simulate all the L1 seeds that
were active during the 2018D data set.

To run the simulation:

```console
$ ./trigger_test.py -n 100000
```

To test the affect of various ways to compute the trigger scale factors, you can run it with the following options:

- `--use-real-ips`: By default we simulate things where the data has the impact parameter significance overestimated relative to the true impact parameter significance, which is how the actual data is. When run with this flag we instead use the real IPS when computing the categories and the trigger scale factors. This is similar to what should happen after we apply the impact parameter error correction.
- `--disable-l1`: Currently the trigger scale factors are computed by applying an L1 pt cut, this disables that cut
- `--disable-prescale`: Currently the trigger scale factors are computed by only looking at events where a given trigger was active. This flag disables this cut.
